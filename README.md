### Background and Overview
The purpose of this project is to visualize how common living conditions were and are associated with tech bubbles in the US. I have correlated a few different things: 
* House prices in Silicon Valley over time.
* Software Engineering Salaries in Silicon Valley over time.
* Market capitalization of Tech companies in the US over time.
* Employment rate of Software Engineers in Silicon Valley over time.
* An overlay of the market capitalization of tech companies with house prices in Silicon Valley
* An overlay of the market capitalization of tech companies with Software Engineering Salaries in Silicon Valley
* An overlay of Software Engineering salaries in Silicon Valley with market capitalization of tech companies
* An overlay of Software Engineering salaries in Silicon Valley with house prices in Silicon Valley

### Time lapsing data

The graphs that will be rendered will utilize API calls. There will be points to represent the data, which will gradually move over time to represent how everything changed in response to events leading up to and immediately after the US tech bubble.

### Technologies
* The D3 javascript library will be used to render JSON files
* CSS and HTML will be used to visualize the data generated directly from API calls.
